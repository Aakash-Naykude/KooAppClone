                <p>Koo is one of the very few apps that allows you to express your opinions in your mother tongue. So far we support 8 languages in India and 1 5 of Nigeria with more coming soon.

                <p>We are sorry that you want to leave Koo. You can delete your Account by going to ‚öô > Delete. Once requested the account goes in suspension for the next 30 days. This period is given so that if the user wants to use Koo again he can do so. During the suspension if the user logs in the request to delete gets cancelled. After 30 days the account along with all the details are erased from our servers.</p>

                <div className="h2">Q. My feed is not updating. What should I do?</div>
                <p>Feed might not be updating because of the following reasons:</p>
                <p>(a) Feed will take a little time to load if you've logged in after many days, as in, a minimum of 3-4 days. Please refresh once and wait for sometime and it will be good to go.</p>
                <p>(b) Feed is also dependent on the activity of the proÔ¨Åles one follows. In case you are following less proÔ¨Åles we request you to follow more interesting proÔ¨Åles. Also, if you follow someone who doesn't post regularly then also your feed will not be updated. We would request you to follow who posts actively on Koo.</p>
                <p>If the issue persists for more than a day, this is not the expected behavior. Kindly drop us an email at redressal@kooapp.com along with your handle and screen recording or screenshot, we will Ô¨Åx it.</p>
